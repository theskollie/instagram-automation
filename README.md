# Instagram Automation

Created an Instagram automation script that will like posts on a specific hashtag.  
Currently running this in the Chrome console on a Raspberry Pi.  
If you found me through this tool, hi!

### Description
The script dynamically likes posts with 2 randomized timeout's between input on the specified hashtag.  
A recursive setTimeOut is used until 100 images have been liked.  

Like Delay - Between 12-20 Seconds Randomized on each loop iteration  
Next Photo Delay - Between 2.3-4 Seconds Randomized on each loop iteration

Created a new Instagram account to test this script and will report back with results.  
Started: 25 March 2022
## Optimizations

I'll be adding functionality to randomly skip liking every x photo to ensure not every single photo on the hashtag is liked.

This project is just for fun and if you work for Instagram and have an issue with it, contact me - I am friendly.
